<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


AI Reddit Profiler is an AI-driven tool (powered by Llama3) designed to analyze Reddit profiles and generate comprehensive user insights based on the data extracted from their activity. 

By feeding in a Reddit username, the tool gathers and processes information such as karma, account creation date, subreddit participation, posts, and moderation status. The AI then produces a detailed profile, which includes inferred personal details, psychological analysis, and a summary of the user's online persona. 


Key Features: 
* Extracts Reddit user information and formats it for analysis. 
* Generates detailed user profiles, including personal details, psychological insights, and general assumptions. 
*  Saves the AI-generated profile as a text file for further use.
